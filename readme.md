# Multimodal Suicide Risk Detection using Deep Learning

An AI-powered research project aiming to detect early signs of suicide risk using both **textual** and **visual** data. The system combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of mental health assessments.

## 🚀 Project Status ![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-yellow)


🔧 **In Development** — currently working on integrating DistilBERT for text analysis and YOLOv11 for visual behavior recognition.

## 🎯 Objective

To create a hybrid AI system that can assist in early detection of suicidal tendencies by analyzing:
- **Text inputs** (e.g., social media posts, chat conversations)
- **Facial expressions and behavior** via visual data

This project is motivated by the rising suicide rates in countries like **Japan** and several **European nations**, and it aims to contribute to early intervention strategies in mental health support.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **PyTorch**  
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**  
- **DistilBERT** (fine-tuned)  
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**  
- **YOLOv11** for real-time object and facial expression detection  
- **Google Colab** for training and experimentation

## 📊 Current Progress

- ✅ Fine-tuned **DistilBERT** for text classification with >90% validation accuracy  
- ✅ Developed hybrid model **DistilBERT + CNN**  
- ⏳ Integrating YOLOv11 for multimodal input  
- 🔜 Training and evaluating on visual datasets

## 🔍 Future Work

- Complete multimodal data pipeline  
- Improve generalization on real-world mental health data  
- Collaborate with professionals for data labeling and validation  
- Deploy as a web-based support system or clinical tool

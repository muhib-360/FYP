# YOLOv11 for Suicidal Behavior Detection #

- This project is currently in the development phase. We're exploring the potential of using YOLOv11 for detecting behavioral indicators related to suicide risk through visual data (e.g., facial expressions, body language, environment analysis). YOLOv11 is known for its high efficiency and real-time object detection capabilities, which may provide valuable insights in psychological assessments.


## Key Benefits ##

- Real-time Detection: Fast and efficient, suitable for analyzing video or images in real-time.
- High Accuracy: Improved detection accuracy for small and complex patterns.
- Resource Efficient: Optimized for both performance and memory usage.

## Current Focus ##

- At this stage, we are investigating the potential benefits of YOLOv11 for suicide behavior assessment. We're particularly interested in how it can help detect subtle behavioral patterns that could indicate distress or risk.
- Additionally, we are looking into combining YOLOv11 with models like VisualBERT or similar architectures that can process both visual and textual modalities simultaneously for a more comprehensive analysis.
